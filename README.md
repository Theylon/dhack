What is dHack?
dHack is a novel hackathon model that is true to the ethos of Ethereum. We use state of the art governance models and practices to put decisions in the hands of the community, making for a more sustainable and engaging model for hackathons and grant programs.

Why do this?

Hackathons’ centralized judging committees clash with our community’s ideals about decentralization. We think the community should have the power to pick hackathon winners, and by extension, facilitate better curation of Ethereum’s next great projects.

More coming....
